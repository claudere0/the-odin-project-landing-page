After 3 hours of coding, it is finally done!
"There are many ways to tackle a project like this, and it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document and not know where to start. Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan."
- made 6 sections instead of 4 (header, random-info, quote, call-to-action and footer)

"For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. You’ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will take more time and may cause more frustration. (Note: you don’t need to use more than one stylesheet. Using only one CSS file is adequate for this project)."
- I didn't notice that I had to do the HTML first and only then the CSS. I first created the section structure, then added the HTML and looped the CSS, and so on for each section.

"Many of the elements on this page are very similar to things you saw in our flexbox exercises… feel free to go back to those if you need a refresher."
- flexbox is a powerful tool, it was a pleasure to work with it. Essentially, you can do everything with Flexbox, it just won't be effective everywhere.
